<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is  Mohammed Suhail Abdul Haq. 
  I am 29 years old. Currently residing in the beautiful City of Durban South Africa.
    I was born on the brink of freedom,as south africa finally became a democratic country ,i was introduced tot he world.
  happy to be here </p>

<p>I am a loving husband, and father of wo beautiful girls. Art and soccer are embedded in soul, as i am an Arsenal fan. when it comes to pets i would prefer a fluffy cat,
I can fit in easily I generally am very jolly around new faces and I make friends quick and adapting to different enviroments comes natuaral to me.
One of my many dreams I would say is to travel the world-especially the country-side of Europe.

<p>I believe in myself ,quiet the  go getter I would say, given the oppotunity I can prove to
  to be an asset to any company ,although my dream is to one-day work from home .I believe i have alot to learn and much exprience to gain
.i am full of confidence and at the samtime sometimes very shy however i tend to be quiet the observer.
